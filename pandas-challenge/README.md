#Bootcampspot tutor (Keli): She helped me get started on this assignment by explaining how pandas function.

#ChatGPT: Helped me smooth out errors I had in my code and gave me some lines of codes to use such as:

#Calculate the total school budget and per capita spending per school

#per_school_budget = school_data.groupby('school_name')['budget'].sum()

#print("Total School Budget:")

#per_school_budget

#per_school_capita

#per_school_capita = per_school_budget / per_school_counts

#print("\nPer Capita Spending per School:")

#per_school_capita

#school_students_passing_math = school_data_complete.groupby("school_name")["math_score"].apply(lambda x: (x >= 70).sum())

#AskBCS Learning Assistant:

#ngumede(Zim)- Helped me solve this error (ValueError: Buffer has wrong number of dimensions (expected 1, got 2))

#scele2(Sibu)- She helped me trouble shoot my code when I couldn't figure out what was off about my data. She helped me solve 

#various kinds of errors as we both experimented with my code.

#rahir(Rhythm)- He showed me how to adjust my formatting for Scores by School Spending
